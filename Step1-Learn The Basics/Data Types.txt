Problem statement
Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.



Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

Integer: 4 bytes
Long: 8 bytes
Float: 4 bytes
Double: 8 bytes
Character: 1 byte


You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.



Example :
Input: Long

Output: 8

Explanation: The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
Long


Sample Output 1:
8


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.


Sample Input 2:
Float


Sample Output 2:
4


Explanation of sample input 2 :
The size of a Float variable is given as 4 bytes.


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(1).


Constraints :
‘type’ is one of the data types given above.

Time limit: 1 second


<===== Attempted Solution =====>

=====> Python Solution :

Sol 1:
          
# def dataTypes(data_type: str):
#     if data_type == 'Integer':
#         print('4')
#     elif data_type == 'Long':
#         print('8')
#     elif data_type == 'Float':
#         print('4')
#     elif data_type == 'Double':
#         print('8')
#     elif data_type == 'Character':
#         print('1')

# Example usage:
# dataTypes('Integer')  # Output: 4 bytes

Sol 2:

from typing import *
data = {'Integer':4,'Long':8,'Float':4,'Double':8,'Character':1}
def dataTypes(type: str):
    return data[type]
